Q. what are control statements ?
Ans.  Two Types
      1. Conditional Statements
      2. Iterative Statements.

      control statements are used to control the flow of execution flow of program.
      They allow a program to make decisions  based on certain conditions .
      and to repeat certain sections of code depending on the conditions.


Q. Explain different  types of Conditional Statements ? 
  OR Name the Decision making statements in java ?
Ans.  three types of Conditional  statments
      1. If
      2. If else
      3. switch

      If(Condition)
        executes a block of code if the condition if is True.
        if the Condition is false the block of code is skipped.

      if else Statement.
        It Executes One block of code  if The Condtion is True and Another block of code if the condition is false.

     Switch Statement
         It used to Select One of the Many Blocks of Code to be Executed Depending on the Value of the Variable.

Q.   Explain the Syntax of IF Else statment with the Example ?
Ans     if(Condition)            
            //If the Condition is true then executes block of  Statements.
        else
            //If the Condition is false then executes block of  Statements.

Q.    what are DataTypes in Java ?
Ans.     

Q. TypeCasting


Q.    diff between Byte and Char in java.


Q.     Diff betn int and Integer which one takes more memory.



Q.     Explain the Java.lang package;


Q.     Why Java is Secure.
        java is Secure  becoz it doesn't  allow pointers.
        Bytecode Verifier it verifies the bytecode is valid before executing.

Q.     Why java Is platform Independent.
ans.   Write Once And Run Anywhere.

Q.    what is an Identifier.
ans.    Identifier is used to identify the class method and variable.
        In Java, an identifier is a name used to identify a variable, method, class, or other entities within a program. Identifiers serve as user-defined names
        for various elements in the code and play a crucial role in making the code                readable and understandable. It is essential to follow certain rules while naming identifiers in Java:

        Rules for naming identifiers in Java:
                    The name must begin with a letter (A-Z or a-z) or an underscore (_).
                    After the initial letter, the name can consist of letters, digits (0-9), and underscores (_).
                    Java is case-sensitive, so uppercase and lowercase letters are considered distinct.
                    The identifier must not be a reserved word or a keyword used in Java (e.g., public, class, int, if, etc.).
                    It is recommended to use descriptive names that convey the purpose of the entity being named for better code readability.
                    Examples of valid identifiers:
                                                    int age;
                                                    String firstName;
                                                    double _price;
                                                    // Invalid: Starts with a digit
                                                    int 2ndNumber;

                                                    // Invalid: Contains special characters other than underscore
                                                    float temp&humidity;
        
                                                    // Invalid: Reserved keyword used as identifier
                                                    String class;

                                                    // Invalid: Uses spaces in the name
                                                    double average score;
                    It is important to choose meaningful and descriptive names for identifiers to enhance code readability and maintainability.
                    Following the Java naming conventions will also help in writing more maintainable and consistent  code.
         
Q.      what is Constant in java.
Ans.    using final Keyword.
        how are the constants and  variables are important 
        they are important to store and manipulate the data.
        constant are the values that we unchanged throughout the Program.
        Variables are the values that can be changed.
